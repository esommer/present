=======

A simple one-page program for a literary magazine contribution. The prompt: Variations on the word "present", whatever that means to you. The magazine: ["Variations On"](http://variationson.us). The code itself was printed in the magazine, leaving it up to the reader to seek out its active presence on the web.

###See the code in action [here](http://emilysommer.com/present).

*Please don't judge this code harshly -- it was thrown together in a few hours, and was intended to be as comprehensible to the non-technical as possible.
